   - Channel simulations with IBIS-AMI models and giving channel routing recommendations on the basis
    of topology, equalization techniques etc.
2. ### Associate Engineer-2 [Microsemi India Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad, India.](https://www.microsemi.com/) (July, 2017-Dec, 2018)
   - Worked on I/O selection, simulation and validation of high speed I/O, package and board characteristics
    in SPICE and IBIS environment.
    
   - Simulation of a complete IO channel(Tx and Rx) to extract system performance parameters such as rise/fall
    times, rise/fall delays, jitter etc.
    
   - Signal integrity analysis of MIPI and LVDS standard in spice environment
    
   - Worked on implementing special IO interfaces CAN,SPI,I2C,USB,MMUART,SD etc.
    
   - Worked on understanding and verification of DDRPHY and SGMIIPHY system blocks and clocking environment.
    
   - Timing and power Analysis of buffer paths on post layout extracted netlist for DDRPHY and SGMII IP blocks.
3. ### Intern [Microsemi India Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad, India.](https://www.microsemi.com/) (Jan, 2017- July, 2017)

4. ### Teaching Assistant [Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, New Delhi, India](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/) (Aug, 2015- Dec,2017)
   - Maths(Linear algebra) (1st and 3rd semester).  
   - Basic Electronics (2nd semester).
    
## Academic Projects
1. ### Analysis of Power Distribution Networks in VLSI Circuits
   Active analog and digital techniques for modeling decap in PDN
    
2. ### Analysis of the Robustness of a Power Distribution Networks
   Analysis of timing delay due to supply voltage variations.
    
3. ### Modeling of an active decap circuit for a Power Distribution Network
   A decap circuit is proposed and replaced by the active capacitor in the circuit to reduce the voltage
    drop in a Power Distribution Network.
    
4. ### Frequency Domain analysis of on-chip Power distribution networks
   The variations in Power Supply leads to noise in a System-on-chip (SoC) which has adverse effects on 
    its performance in terms of operational frequency, power dissipation and other soft errors. A PDN is 
    modeled and analog and digital IP blocks are considered in various topologies to create the potential
    effect of SSN.
    
5. ### Low-Noise Power Delivery Network Design using Power Transmission Line for mixed signal testing.
   In the mixed signal testing scenario, the performance of a system depends on the noise tolerance and
    the communication speed between various analog and digital circuits which share a Power Delivery network(PDN). 
    Modeling of a PDN to reduce noise and simulations done on ADS Tool.
    
6. ### Low power Network-on-chip for high performance SoC design.
   A low power router technique is designed. The technique used is the CPAT(Crossbar Partial Activation Technique)
    
7. ### Smart street lighting system based on Internet of Things.
   The project is demonstrated using LEDs , LDR’s , motion sensors, temperature sensors and and control function
    is handled by the Intel Galileo Board.
