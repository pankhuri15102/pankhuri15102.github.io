I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computational and Data Sciences (CDS)](http://www.cds.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://www.iisc.ac.in/) with a research focus on Machine Learning and related areas. I am supervised by [Prof. Partha Pratim Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/), and have been affiliated with the [Machine And Language Learning Lab (MALL Lab)](http://malllabiisc.github.io/) since August 2018.

Prior to graduate school, I received my Bachelor of Engineering (BE Hons.) in Computer Science from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani)](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2015.

## Academic Projects
# - Analysis of Power Distribution Networks in VLSI Circuits
    - Active analog and digital techniques for modeling decap in PDN
# - Analysis of the Robustness of a Power Distribution Networks
    - Analysis of timing delay due to supply voltage variations.
# - Modeling of an active decap circuit for a Power Distribution Network
    - A decap circuit is proposed and replaced by the active capacitor in the circuit to reduce the voltage drop in a Power Distribution Network.
# - Frequency Domain analysis of on-chip Power distribution networks
    - The variations in Power Supply leads to noise in a System-on-chip (SoC) which has adverse effects on its performance in terms of operational frequency, power dissipation and other soft errors. A PDN is modeled and analog and digital IP blocks are considered in various topologies to create the potential effect of SSN.
# - Low-Noise Power Delivery Network Design using Power Transmission Line for mixed signal testing.
    - In the mixed signal testing scenario, the performance of a system depends on the noise tolerance and the communication speed between various analog and digital circuits which share a Power Delivery network(PDN). Modeling of a PDN to reduce noise and simulations done on ADS Tool.
# - Low power Network-on-chip for high performance SoC design.
    - A low power router technique is designed. The technique used is the CPAT(Crossbar Partial Activation Technique)
# - Smart street lighting system based on Internet of Things.
    - The project is demonstrated using LEDs , LDR’s , motion sensors, temperature sensors and and control function is handled by the Intel Galileo Board.
